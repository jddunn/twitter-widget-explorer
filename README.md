# twitter-widget-explorer
A tool that puts tweets from a Twitter widget on display in a clear, stylized way on the web, starting with the first tweet and changing to the next every 3 seconds. 

The demo included is for seeing Twitter posts from users who "got hacked" (Or otherwise included those exact words in their post). Demo site is at: http://jddunn.github.io/twitterers-hacked

Special thanks to Jason Mayes for his Twitter Fetcher library that made this possible: http://jasonmayes.com/projects/twitterApi/
